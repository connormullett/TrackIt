# About
Toy implementation of a bug tracking API idea. The general idea is
to be similar to a backend platform for tracking issues through
completions on applications/projects. Like a kanban board. The idea is
to keep it simple and probably wont have crazy customization like
custom tags or labels (like github).

# Immediate Todo List
 - [ ] Auth with JWT, maybe 0Auth2
 - [ ] Extract "business logic", controller and repository layer
    shouldn't be responsible for mapping dto's
 - [ ] Projects model and logic
